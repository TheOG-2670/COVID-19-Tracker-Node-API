# COVID-19-Tracker-Node-API

This API developed in NodeJS fetches data from an external API endpoint, parses and caches the data into a JSON file, and sends it back to the React app to be displayed. 
It also periodically updates the cached data via an API call interval set in the React app.

**Note**: Completed under v1.0
